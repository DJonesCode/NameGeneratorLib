# NameGeneratorLib

This is an example of how to build a Randomized Name Generation system. This type of system could be used in psuedo data generators or video games.

#### How it Works
The code is a DLL that can be referenced in projects. The code loads embedded text files that store the names on each line and uses C# Random to choose a random line
the file. 


#### Text Files
The code allows you to choose which rows in the file to start and stop at. For this example, I grabbed some big lists that I found on the internet. The sources are at the top
of the files.
